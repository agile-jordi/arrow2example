# arrow2example

A toy example of Arrow2 with Kotlin Context Receivers.

Take into account that:

- I'm using a locally deployed version of Arrow 2 (not even an alpha, commit 84ce8cb). This is subject to change.
- Context receivers are an experimental feature. They are subject to change.

So this is just an experiment to play with the future of FP in Kotlin.
